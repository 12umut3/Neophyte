### Project Description

Project Neophyte is a learning tool for children in elementary school and middle school ages. This tool helps children understand the concept of programming by teaching them the way of computer scientists and basics of simple algorithms. As it was discussed in the introduction, it is important for children to learn algorithm creation in early ages, as it will affect their problem solving skills and computational thinking skills.
